#### Task 1

##### Differential GNSS (DGNSS)

1. Pros:
DGNSS significantly improves positioning accuracy by correcting common satellite errors using data from a nearby reference station with a known location. The station compares its true position with the satellite-derived one and broadcasts correction data—accounting for errors like satellite clock drift and ionospheric delays—to nearby users. Smartphones that can receive both GNSS signals and these corrections can reduce positioning errors from several meters to sub-meter or even centimeter levels. DGNSS can be accessed in two ways: via network-based corrections (e.g., NTRIP apps like RTK2go or Lefebure) or through satellite-based augmentation systems (SBAS) such as WAAS or EGNOS. Alternatively, smartphones can connect to external high-precision GNSS receivers like the u-blox F9P to receive accurate location data.
2. Cons:
However, DGNSS use on smartphones faces several limitations. Many phones do not expose raw GNSS data or support correction injection. Even with capable hardware, support depends on the GNSS chipset and firmware. Internet-based corrections require stable connectivity, which may be unavailable in remote areas. SBAS is region-limited and less precise than RTK. External receivers improve accuracy but add cost, complexity, and power consumption. DGNSS is thus better suited for professional applications rather than general consumer use with current mobile devices.

##### Real-Time Kinematic (RTK)

1. Pros:
    RTK greatly enhances smartphone navigation by reducing positioning errors from several meters to centimeter-level accuracy, making it ideal for applications requiring high precision, such as augmented reality, geotagging, and autonomous navigation. With access to raw GNSS data and correction signals, modern Android phones can support real-time RTK processing, offering low-cost, portable, and flexible solutions for precise navigation.
2. Cons:
    However, RTK on smartphones faces limitations. Many phones lack high-quality antennas, suffer from multipath interference, and have unstable GNSS clocks, reducing accuracy. Continuous correction data—usually via NTRIP—requires reliable internet access, which is not always available. Additionally, not all smartphones support raw GNSS data or real-time RTK integration, and setup may involve external receivers and technical knowledge.

##### Precise Point Positioning (PPP)

1. Pros:
    Precise Point Positioning (PPP) enables global, high-precision GNSS navigation on smartphones without needing a nearby reference station. With dual-frequency GNSS, carrier-phase data, and global correction products, PPP can provide post-processed accuracy of 0.5–1 meter, and even decimeter-level under ideal conditions. It's ideal for global applications like mapping, surveying, and location-based services where real-time infrastructure is unavailable. Modern Android phones (e.g., Pixel, Xiaomi, Samsung) supporting raw GNSS data and dual-frequency reception can participate in PPP workflows using tools like GNSS Logger and gLAB.
2. Cons:
    However, PPP has limitations on smartphones. Low-grade antennas suffer from multipath and signal noise, making phase tracking less stable. PPP requires long convergence times (10–30 minutes), which is impractical for short sessions. Single-frequency phones lack proper ionospheric correction, reducing accuracy. Moreover, real-time PPP on phones is still rare and often limited by hardware and API constraints.

##### PPP-RTK
1. Pros:
    PPP-RTK combines the global availability of PPP with the fast convergence and centimeter-level accuracy of RTK, making it ideal for smartphone-based real-time navigation. Modern Android devices with dual-frequency GNSS, fast internet, and access to embedded services (like Google’s Precise Location) can leverage PPP-RTK to achieve high precision without a nearby base station. It's suitable for lane-level navigation, AR, and mapping, and can also work via external receivers or cloud-based correction services.
2. Cons:
    However, smartphone limitations remain. Small, embedded antennas suffer from multipath and weak signal tracking, reducing phase stability and delaying ambiguity resolution. Some smartphones restrict access to raw GNSS data or do not support correction injection, limiting third-party use. Real-time PPP-RTK also depends on consistent internet connectivity, and setup can be complex if relying on external hardware or cloud platforms.

#### Task 4

Low Earth Orbit (LEO) communication satellites such as Starlink, OneWeb, Iridium, and Globalstar have drawn increasing attention not only for global broadband coverage but also for their potential use in positioning and navigation. Theoretically, their dense constellation, strong signals, and fast orbital motion offer several advantages over traditional GNSS. However, using LEO communication satellites for navigation remains highly challenging due to multiple technical and systemic limitations.

First, signal acquisition is a major obstacle. Most LEO communication satellites use proprietary signal formats with no publicly documented synchronization structure. Starlink operates in the Ku/Ka-band using high-throughput OFDM-like waveforms and phased-array antennas. These antennas generate narrow spot beams that must be steered precisely toward a terminal, making passive signal detection extremely difficult. The signals are encrypted, and only commercial Starlink terminals can successfully acquire and decode them. Similarly, OneWeb uses Ka-band frequencies with likely DVB-S2X-based downlinks and beam-hopping mechanisms. Without knowledge of beam schedules and physical-layer structures, external receivers cannot passively acquire OneWeb signals. In contrast, Iridium operates in the L-band with a TDMA/FDMA structure and is relatively more accessible. Open-source tools like gr-iridium can be used for passive signal reception, although real-time synchronization still requires effort. Globalstar uses CDMA for uplink, and its bent-pipe architecture means that satellites do not actively transmit structured downlink signals. As a result, there is little useful information for positioning in the downlink, making acquisition extremely difficult.

Second, timing and synchronization pose a major limitation. GNSS satellites maintain precise atomic clocks and are synchronized to a common system time. This global time reference is essential for pseudorange-based positioning. In contrast, LEO communication satellites generally do not maintain synchronized clocks across the constellation, and they do not transmit user-accessible timing information. Even if a signal could be acquired, the lack of consistent time tagging prevents precise time-of-arrival extraction, making it difficult or impossible to compute distances for trilateration. Furthermore, if a system employs encrypted or non-deterministic signal scheduling, timing reconstruction becomes even harder.

Third, accurate satellite position information is not readily available. Unlike GNSS, which broadcasts real-time ephemeris and clock corrections, LEO communication satellites do not transmit such data to users. As a result, users must rely on publicly available orbital data such as Two-Line Elements (TLEs). TLEs are designed for coarse orbit propagation using the SGP4 model. While TLEs can provide sufficient accuracy for satellite visibility prediction and Doppler shift estimation over a short horizon of a few days, they are unsuitable for precise positioning. LEO satellites are affected strongly by atmospheric drag, especially during periods of high solar activity, which alters their orbit rapidly. Satellites like those in the Starlink constellation frequently adjust their orbits, and such maneuvers are not reflected in public TLE data. Therefore, unless TLEs are updated frequently—ideally daily—the resulting orbit predictions become unreliable. Moreover, TLEs lack precise onboard timing information, further compounding the error in positioning applications.

Fourth, the Doppler effect, while potentially useful, introduces significant complexity. LEO satellites orbit the Earth at high speeds, leading to rapid Doppler shifts on the order of ±100 to ±200 kHz in Ku/Ka-band systems and around ±5 kHz in L-band systems like Iridium. This rapid shift not only complicates signal acquisition and tracking but also requires fast updating of frequency estimates in real time. For Doppler-based positioning, precise knowledge of satellite velocity and heading is essential, which again is limited by the inaccuracy of TLEs. While the strong and rapidly changing Doppler signature is valuable for velocity estimation or relative positioning, leveraging it effectively requires fine-grained control over receiver processing and high-fidelity orbital predictions.

Fifth, integration constraints limit access to the signal and control layers. Most LEO communication systems are vertically integrated, meaning that the signal acquisition, synchronization, decoding, and user interface layers are all contained within proprietary terminals. Starlink terminals, for instance, carry out beam negotiation and synchronization internally, with no access to raw signal samples or low-level timing data. OneWeb and Globalstar operate similarly. Without open interfaces to the physical or data link layers, third-party receivers or research tools cannot meaningfully extract signal-level information needed for navigation. Iridium is somewhat more open in this regard, as its signals can be monitored with software-defined radio tools, although decoding timing and positioning information still presents difficulties due to its TDMA frame structure.

Finally, there are environmental limitations. LEO satellites operating in high-frequency bands like Ka or Ku suffer from signal degradation due to rain, atmospheric absorption, and obstruction by buildings or terrain. Their narrow beams and short visibility windows—typically under 10 minutes per satellite pass—require seamless handover across satellites for continuous coverage. Urban canyons and indoor environments severely reduce the availability of visible satellites, which undermines positioning continuity. While the lower frequency L-band signals used by Iridium are less susceptible to such degradation, their narrowband nature limits data throughput and time resolution for navigation.

In conclusion, while the idea of using LEO communication satellites for navigation is promising in theory, especially due to their abundant availability and strong Doppler characteristics, the practical challenges are formidable. Proprietary signal structures, lack of precise timing information, limited orbit data, rapid Doppler dynamics, and restricted terminal access together form a complex set of barriers. Among existing systems, Iridium remains the most accessible for passive signal research, while Starlink and OneWeb offer strong signals but are effectively closed systems. Overcoming these obstacles would require industry collaboration to open up signal standards, provide real-time orbit and timing data, and support third-party access to the physical layer. Until such changes are made, LEO-based navigation will remain a highly constrained research domain rather than a practical alternative to GNSS.

#### Task 5

GNSS Interferometric Reflectometry (GNSS-IR) is an innovative technique that repurposes signals from Global Navigation Satellite Systems (GNSS), such as GPS, Galileo, GLONASS, and BeiDou, for remote sensing applications. Traditionally, GNSS was developed for navigation and positioning, enabling users to determine their location anywhere on Earth with sufficient satellite visibility. However, beyond its primary function, the structure and behavior of GNSS signals—particularly their interactions with Earth's surface—have opened up novel opportunities in environmental monitoring. GNSS-IR represents a passive, cost-effective, and non-intrusive approach to sensing a variety of surface properties, including soil moisture, snow depth, vegetation, sea level, and even infrastructure deformation.

The core principle of GNSS-IR lies in analyzing the interference between the direct signal from a GNSS satellite and the signal reflected off the Earth’s surface before reaching the same receiver. As GNSS satellites traverse the sky, the elevation angle of the signal path to the receiver changes, which causes the geometry between the receiver, satellite, and reflecting surface to vary. This variation introduces oscillations in the received signal’s power, typically observed in the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) data. These oscillations result from constructive and destructive interference between the direct and reflected signals and are influenced by factors such as surface roughness, dielectric properties, and the height of the reflecting surface relative to the antenna.

In the context of remote sensing, GNSS-IR is considered a form of passive bistatic radar. Unlike traditional active sensing systems, such as synthetic aperture radar (SAR) or LiDAR, GNSS-IR does not require a dedicated transmitter. Instead, it leverages existing GNSS signals transmitted continuously from satellites in orbit. This makes GNSS-IR extremely cost-effective and scalable, especially since it can be implemented using existing infrastructure—namely, GNSS ground stations that are already deployed globally for geodetic and geophysical purposes. These stations typically record dual-frequency GNSS data over long periods, providing rich time series data ideal for environmental monitoring.

One of the earliest and most well-established applications of GNSS-IR is snow depth estimation. In snowy regions, as snow accumulates or melts, the surface level relative to the antenna changes. Because the reflected signal now originates from the snow surface instead of bare ground, the geometry of the reflection path changes, resulting in different interference patterns in the SNR data. By tracking the frequency of these patterns, researchers can determine snow depth with high temporal resolution and reasonable spatial accuracy. This capability is particularly valuable for hydrological modeling, climate studies, and water resource management.

Soil moisture is another domain where GNSS-IR has proven useful. Moist soil has a higher dielectric constant than dry soil, leading to increased reflectivity. As a result, changes in soil moisture affect the amplitude and phase of the reflected GNSS signal. By observing changes in the SNR pattern, especially in the early morning when dew formation is common, researchers can infer temporal soil moisture dynamics. Compared with traditional soil moisture sensors, GNSS-IR provides a non-invasive method that can complement satellite-based sensors like SMAP and SMOS.

In coastal and lake environments, GNSS-IR has been utilized to monitor water level changes. By positioning a GNSS antenna close to a shoreline and analyzing the SNR data from low-elevation satellite passes, it is possible to detect vertical displacements of the water surface with centimeter-level precision. This approach is particularly useful in regions with limited tide gauge coverage, offering a complementary tool for oceanography and sea level studies. It also helps improve coastal inundation modeling, especially in the face of rising sea levels and increased storm surges due to climate change.

Vegetation monitoring is a newer application area for GNSS-IR. When vegetation grows around a GNSS antenna, it affects both the reflectivity and scattering properties of the reflected GNSS signals. By analyzing seasonal changes in signal interference patterns, researchers can infer vegetation biomass, phenology, and land cover dynamics. This passive sensing capability can contribute to studies on ecosystem productivity, carbon cycling, and land management.

One of the compelling advantages of GNSS-IR is its resilience to weather and illumination conditions. Unlike optical remote sensing systems, which rely on sunlight and can be obstructed by clouds, GNSS signals can penetrate atmospheric conditions and vegetation to some extent. This makes GNSS-IR a reliable year-round data source, suitable for long-term environmental monitoring. Furthermore, GNSS-IR can be implemented in urban environments, forests, agricultural fields, and polar regions, showcasing its versatility.

From a technical perspective, implementing GNSS-IR requires access to raw GNSS SNR data, which is available from many geodetic stations. The analysis involves filtering and spectral decomposition of the SNR time series to identify dominant frequencies associated with the multipath interference. These frequencies are then related to the effective reflector height or dielectric property through well-defined geometrical relationships. Advanced GNSS-IR systems may integrate machine learning models or use Bayesian filters to improve parameter estimation and reduce noise caused by environmental heterogeneity.

Despite its advantages, GNSS-IR also has limitations. The spatial resolution is constrained by the antenna’s physical geometry and the satellite’s signal footprint, which is typically several meters to tens of meters. The technique also requires a relatively open environment around the antenna to avoid excessive scattering from buildings or irregular terrain. Moreover, interpreting GNSS-IR data can be complex in mixed land cover or when multiple reflection surfaces are present, such as a thin snow layer over wet soil.

In recent years, the field has expanded beyond fixed GNSS ground stations. Mobile platforms, including drones and autonomous vehicles, are being explored as carriers of GNSS-IR sensors. This opens up opportunities for high-resolution mapping of snow, water, and vegetation over large areas. Additionally, integration with other sensing modalities, such as radar, hyperspectral imaging, or wireless sensor networks, allows for data fusion and improved environmental modeling.

In conclusion, GNSS Interferometric Reflectometry is a promising tool in the remote sensing toolbox, offering a low-cost, passive, and multi-purpose approach to monitoring Earth’s surface conditions. Its ability to repurpose existing GNSS infrastructure into environmental sensors enhances the value of long-term geodetic networks. As climate change and environmental degradation become more pressing global issues, GNSS-IR provides a scalable and adaptable method for tracking critical variables that influence weather, hydrology, agriculture, and ecosystems. Continued advances in GNSS technology, signal processing algorithms, and data accessibility will further strengthen the role of GNSS-IR in operational and scientific remote sensing in the years ahead.
